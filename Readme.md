# battlepass json: so you can have working purchasable battlepass on your private server (you ofc have to code it in mcp.js and function.js)
  
## please credit me when you use it

## added battlepass: s2-s3-s4-s5-s6-s7-s8-s9-s10-s11-s12-s13

## s1 isn't compatible

## i wont do s14 since it contains copyright material from Marvel

## i wont do c2 s7 and above since the new battlepass system is coded diffrent and no current backend supports it (please tell me if there is)
